# üç™How the cookie is made

This tool reads all logfiles from the given logpath at the start of every hour. It will extract all entries from the logs and insert them into a mysql database.

From there it will monitor the logs and create reports.

As configured the reports can be created daily, weekly or monthly. Each report will generate a pdf file with a overview of the generated logs in the corrosponding timeframe.

These Reports will be sent through a telegram bot and placed in a configured folder on the system.

If configured, beginning at a specific loglevel alerts can be created and send through a telegram Bot.
